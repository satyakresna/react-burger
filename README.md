# React Burger

Build order burger web app with React

## Why I Create This?

Actually this is a project from [React and Redux course from Udemy by Academind](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/). This project in that course was use React and Redux but I want to try to use React only and no Redux. Also, I want to use React base class component instead of React base functional components (hooks).

Since create this project I learn that React is difficult but exciting but I don't want to use React for serious project and production right now because learning curve and it's difficult to understand React. 

This is based on my personal opinion and I have the right to choose what the stack I want to use for having fun or for production.

## How to run

Clone and run `npm install` then run `npm run start`. This project is created with Create React App.
